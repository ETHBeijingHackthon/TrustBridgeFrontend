## Introduction

Welcome to the Blockchain Review Protocol! This protocol is designed to provide a decentralized platform for publishing and reviewing NFTs on the blockchain. With this protocol, anyone can publish NFTs containing any type of content, whether it's a movie, music, food, or anything else that can be represented digitally.

Overall, this protocol provides a decentralized and transparent platform for publishing and reviewing NFTs. So, whether you're a content creator or a reviewer, this protocol is the perfect solution for sharing your work and discovering great content.

## Features

### Creating and Publishing NFTs

This protocol allows users to create and publish NFTs containing any content on the blockchain, such as movies, food, music, and more. The metadata of the published NFTs includes a cover, title, description, and multimedia content, which can be an image, video, or audio.

### Reviewing NFTs

After publishing an NFT, other users can review it by creating an NFT of the same contract, with its metadata containing a field pointing to the NFT being reviewed. The metadata of the reviewed NFTs includes a field pointing to the NFT being reviewed, a score, description, and multimedia content, which can also be an image, video, or audio.

### Calculating Average Score

The NFT being reviewed records the number of reviews and calculates the average score. This allows users to quickly determine the overall quality of an NFT and make more informed decisions about whether to collect it.

### Collecting NFTs

Users can also collect NFTs and record the number of times related NFTs are collected. This allows users to keep track of their favorite NFTs and see which ones are the most popular among the community.

Overall, the Review Protocol on the Blockchain provides a powerful tool for creating, reviewing, and collecting NFTs, with features designed to help users make informed decisions about the quality of NFTs and keep track of their favorites.

## Future Development

- By introducing SBTs to the protocol, to enhance the security and authenticity of the reviews and ratings provided by users. SBTs can serve as a way to certify that a review was made by a verified user and that the review is linked to the specific NFT being reviewed. SBT can be used to track the reputation of users based on the quality and accuracy of their reviews. Users who consistently provide valuable feedback can help to establish their credibility and trustworthiness within the community.

- Adding Like and Dislike Functions: By adding like and dislike functions, users can quickly and easily show their appreciation or dissatisfaction with a particular NFT or review. This will allow users to sort and filter reviews based on their popularity, making it easier to find the most helpful or relevant feedback.

- Introducing the Honor System: The Honor System is a reputation-based system that rewards users for contributing positively to the community. By allowing users to earn honor points for writing helpful reviews, responding to comments, and contributing to discussions, you can encourage a positive and supportive community.

- Score Weight Calculation: By adding score weight calculation, you can assign different weights to the reviews based on the reviewer's reputation or expertise in a particular subject. This will ensure that the most knowledgeable and trustworthy reviewers have a greater influence on the final score of the NFT, which will help to increase the accuracy and relevance of the reviews.

- Social

- Incentive

## Conclusion

The review protocol on the blockchain offers a decentralized and transparent way to publish and review content. By leveraging the immutability and security of blockchain technology, this protocol can provide a tamper-proof record of all reviews and ratings, making it an ideal solution for online marketplaces, review sites, and social media platforms.

One of the primary benefits of this protocol is that it enables creators and content owners to receive valuable feedback on their work in a fair and transparent manner. The use of NFTs allows for the creation of unique, verifiable, and tradeable assets that can represent any type of content, from movies to music and beyond.

Moreover, the protocol can incentivize users to contribute their reviews and feedback by rewarding them with tokens or other forms of value. This can help to increase user engagement, improve the quality of reviews, and create a more vibrant and active community around the content being reviewed.

The potential applications of the review protocol on the blockchain are numerous, ranging from online marketplaces and e-commerce sites to social media platforms and content sharing communities. It can be particularly useful for niche markets where quality feedback is hard to come by, such as independent movies, music, and art.

In conclusion, the review protocol on the blockchain is an innovative and exciting way to publish and review content that can benefit both creators and consumers alike. We encourage you to try it out and explore its potential applications in your own projects and communities. Please check out our Github repository for more information and to get started.
